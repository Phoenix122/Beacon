This is a web app developed in HackIllinois 2017
We wanted to create an app which would provide a real-time network of people to help each other by sharing their talents.
Basically bridge the gap between someone who wants a service and someone who has the skill to provide that service, 
ensuring quality and flexible prices.
How is our product different from the existing ones like handy or thumbtack?
(1) Users rate and tip for the service received. And we match their tip depending on your rating! - This is an incentive which motivates service providers to do better. And the end users are happy. It is a win-win for all ! Eg: As always, a provider who is rated 3 or less would never be matched with that user again, and will not be eligible for our  tip matching. On the other hand, a person who receives 4 or 5 rating would receive 2% or 3 % of the tip paid as an incentive.
(2) No one lets you negotiate prices!! But we do. The users can negotiate prices for the services requested. And the providers can accept or deny providing a service. In this way, the app stays fair to all.
There is no need for a long term commitment - we just give/get the services on the go.
This app is to fulfill everyday tasks that might not be done or may be difficult if you are a new-mom or an elderly man.
Every data is real-time. We let seekers find providers in real-time based on their location.
There is no big investment here. We just build the app and let the people create both supply and demand for the app to sustain in the market. Three reasons to why there is going to be a constant supply and demand here:
          1) Current unemployment rate is 4.8% .
          2) Long-term unemployed is 24.4% of this.
          3) Labor force participation has increased from 0.2% to 62.9% in January 2017.
          AND FRANKLY, WHO DOESNâ€™T WANT TO MAKE A FEW EXTRA BUCKS?!
